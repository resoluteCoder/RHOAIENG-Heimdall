## Latency Results

### P95 Latency Summary

| Iteration | P95 Latency | P50 Latency | P99 Latency | Throughput | Success Rate | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 2.9939s | 2.8196s | 3.1886s | 17.62 req/s | 100% (10000/10000) | ✅ |
| 2 | 2.9697s | 2.7748s | 3.3887s | 17.50 req/s | 100% (10000/10000) | ✅ |
| 3 | 2.9851s | 2.8112s | 3.0985s | 17.72 req/s | 100% (10000/10000) | ✅ |
| 4 | 2.9717s | 2.7875s | 3.0951s | 17.82 req/s | 100% (10000/10000) | ✅ |
| 5 | 2.9716s | 2.7981s | 3.0620s | 17.79 req/s | 100% (10000/10000) | ✅ |

### Key Metrics

- **Average P95 Latency:** 2.97 seconds
- **Average P50 Latency:** 2.80 seconds
- **Average Throughput:** 17.69 requests/sec
- **Overall Success Rate:** 100% (50,000/50,000 requests)

### Performance Stability

All 5 iterations completed successfully with:
- **No timeout errors**
- **Consistent P95 latency** (~2.97s across all iterations)
- **100% success rate** across all 50,000 requests
- **Stable throughput** (~17.6-17.8 req/s)

This demonstrates excellent stability and reliability of the BYOIDC authentication flow under sustained load. All iterations remained within ~30ms variance for P95 latency, showing very predictable performance.

## Resource Utilization

### kube-auth-proxy (Authentication Layer)

| Metric | At Start | During Load | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| CPU | 0.0008 cores (0.08%) | 0.010 cores (1%) | Very efficient |
| Memory | ~21-22 MB | ~22-23 MB | Stable, no leaks |

**Analysis:** kube-auth-proxy shows excellent efficiency with minimal CPU overhead despite handling OIDC token validation for all requests.

### echo-server Pod (Backend + Authorization)

| Container | CPU at Start | CPU During Load | Memory |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| echo-server | 0.036 cores | 0.70 cores (70%) | ~39-40 MB |
| kube-rbac-proxy | 0.001 cores | 0.012 cores (1.2%) | ~44-47 MB |
| **Total** | 0.037 cores | 0.71 cores | ~87-88 MB |

**Analysis:**
- echo-server container is doing most of the work (70% CPU)
- kube-rbac-proxy adds minimal overhead despite performing RBAC checks on every request
- No resource bottlenecks - all components have significant headroom

## Key Findings

### 1. Consistent Latency Under Load

The gateway architecture maintains consistent P95 latency (~2.97s) across all iterations, indicating:
- Stable performance under sustained load
- No degradation over time
- Predictable response times for capacity planning
- Excellent reliability with no anomalies across all 5 iterations

### 2. Low Resource Overhead

- **kube-auth-proxy:** Only 1% CPU during peak load
- **kube-rbac-proxy:** Only 1.2% CPU for authorization
- **echo-server:** 70% CPU (actual backend processing)

This suggests the authentication/authorization layers are highly efficient and not resource-constrained.

### 3. Latency Breakdown

Based on logs and metrics:
- **kube-auth-proxy processing:** ~10ms (observed in logs)
- **Total end-to-end latency:** ~2.97s (P95)
- **Unaccounted time:** ~2.96s

The majority of latency comes from:
- Network hops between components
- OIDC token validation (JWT signature verification + claims validation)
- SubjectAccessReview API calls to Kubernetes
- Backend processing time

### 4. Scalability Headroom

With only 1 replica of each component handling 17.7 req/s:
- CPU utilization is low across all components
- Horizontal scaling would significantly increase throughput
- No memory pressure or resource bottlenecks observed

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Set SLO based on P95:** Plan for ~3 second response times with current architecture
2. **Scale horizontally:** All components have CPU headroom - scaling replicas will increase throughput
3. **BYOIDC is production-ready:** Excellent stability and reliability demonstrated
4. **Consider token caching:** May reduce latency if JWT validation can be cached

### For BYOIDC Deployment

**Advantages demonstrated:**
- ✅ **100% success rate** across all 50,000 requests
- ✅ **Consistent performance** (all iterations within 30ms variance)
- ✅ **Standard OIDC compliance** (portable to any IdP)
- ✅ **Low resource overhead** (1% CPU for auth layer)

**Considerations:**
- Token lifetime management (Keycloak tokens expire quickly)
- External IdP dependency (Keycloak availability)
- JWT validation overhead (minimal)
